**Short term (v1.1–v1.3)**
- Plugin SDK: typed hooks for AST transforms, codegen augmentation, custom adapters/RLS.
- Example apps: Simple API, Blog, Payments (runnable end-to-end).
- Docs site: full handbook + guides.

**Medium term**
- Additional adapters: MSSQL, Oracle (optional), DuckDB.
- Static analysis: policy/tenant leak detection, dead model/policy warnings.
- Generated admin scaffolding (optional).

**Long term vision**
- Deterministic backend pipelines: rebuild from DSL across environments.
- Cloud-managed migrations: hosted multi-env schema workflows.
- AI-assisted DSL authoring: natural language → domain/policies/routes.

Strategic positioning: LaForge aims to be the Terraform of backend code — declarative backend infrastructure compiled from one specification.
